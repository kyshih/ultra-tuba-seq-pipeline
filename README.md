# Ultra- and Tuba-seq Pipeline
Ultra- and Tuba-seq pipeline from Rogers et al https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5495136/ and https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6061949/. All tumor metrics are calculated using bootstrap resampling method. Regex for recover the sequence needs to be changed depending on the sequence design of each project (dual- vs single-ko or ultra- vs tuba-seq).
